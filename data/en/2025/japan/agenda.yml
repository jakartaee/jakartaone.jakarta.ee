              <p>In an era dominated by Spring and Spring Boot, why should enterprises still choose Jakarta EE? Unlike frameworks tied to single implementations, Jakarta EE is specification-driven, offering vendor-neutrality, stability, and long-term compatibility. Modern Jakarta EE implementations like Open Liberty provide the convenience of lightweight deployments, blending the benefits of frameworks with standardized enterprise-grade capabilities essential for reliable IT systems.</p>

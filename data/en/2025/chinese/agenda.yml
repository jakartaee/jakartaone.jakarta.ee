  - name: A Deep Dive into CRaC Technology：A New Path for Extremely Fast Java Application Startup and Performance Optimization
    presenter: Ma Zhen
    type: keynote
    time: 14:50-15:20 (UTC+8)
    abstract: |
      <p>This session analyzes how CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) technology addresses the pain points of slow cold starts and long warm-up times in Java applications through its snapshot and restore mechanism. It compares the differences between AOT (Ahead-of-Time) and JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation, delves into the underlying implementation and practical applications, and demonstrates its value in microservices and Serverless scenarios.</p>

    presenter: Yipeng Gan
    type: keynote
    time: 16:30-17:00 (UTC+8)
    abstract: |
      <p>A 10-year Java veteran will demonstrate a 10-minute zero-downtime migration of an old system to Jakarta EE 11 on-site; QPS +18%, memory -12%; one-click generation of OCI images, integration with OpenTelemetry and KEDA to achieve Serverless elasticity down to 0; an open-source Maven plugin automatically detects residual javax.\* and reports errors immediately in PRs. The entire session will be a live demo, with scripts and Helm Charts released on the spot.</p>

  - name: Jakarta EE & Java EE Development and IBM Liberty Discussion
    presenter: Limin Yu
    type: keynote
    time: 17:00-17:45 (UTC+8)
    abstract: |
      <p>As digitalization and intelligence accelerate, traditional log analysis and search systems face challenges including data explosion, complex issue identification, and insufficient response timeliness. With the rapid development of large model technologies and AI capabilities, intelligent log analysis platforms are undergoing new architectural transformations. This session will explore the evolution from traditional ELK architecture to AI-powered intelligent platforms, analyzing key capabilities like vector search, log semantic understanding, RAG-enhanced retrieval, and AI-SRE implementation methods. Through enterprise case studies, we'll discuss how to build next-generation log platforms with intelligent insights, adaptive responses, and efficient operations to help organizations transition from "post-incident response" to "intelligent prediction."</p>

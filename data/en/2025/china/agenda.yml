    - name: AI-Driven Evolution of Intelligent Search and Log Platform Architecture
      presenter: Hang Zhou
      type: keynote
      time: 15:45-16:15 (UTC+8)
      abstract: |
              <p>As digitalization and intelligence accelerate, traditional log analysis and search systems face challenges including data explosion, complex issue identification, and insufficient response timeliness. With the rapid development of large model technologies and AI capabilities, intelligent log analysis platforms are undergoing new architectural transformations. This session will explore the evolution from traditional ELK architecture to AI-powered intelligent platforms, analyzing key capabilities like vector search, log semantic understanding, RAG-enhanced retrieval, and AI-SRE implementation methods. Through enterprise case studies, we'll discuss how to build next-generation log platforms with intelligent insights, adaptive responses, and efficient operations to help organizations transition from "post-incident response" to "intelligent prediction."</p>

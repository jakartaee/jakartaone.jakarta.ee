Mostly working with Enterprise technologies, I'm involved with the community to help other individuals to spread the knowledge with my Blog, my YouTube channel and with OSS contributions.

I'm also the leader of the Coimbra JUG, a Java User Group in Portugal with more than 500 members, and founder of the JNation Conference in Portugal a one day event with worldwide speakers.

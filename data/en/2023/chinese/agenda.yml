    - name: New innovation of Java application - How to best improve the native startup of Jakarta EE cloud
      presenter: Emily Jiang
      type: jakarta_ee
      time: 15:40-16:10 GMT+08
      abstract: |
        As you know, Java applications have been facing a huge challenge of slow startup, which makes them at a disadvantage when using serverless in containers because they need to start quickly. In recent years, a technology called GraalVM tries to solve this problem, but it also has some shortcomings, so it has not been widely adopted. The good news is that the InstantOn technology recently released by Open Liberty and OpenJ9 can solve this technical problem without compromise by using Linux CRIU. In the container, your Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications can start in a few hundred milliseconds and still use the traditional JVM. Attend this meeting to learn more and watch the live demonstration.

      time: 14:55-15:25 GMT+08
      abstract: |
        Jakarta EE TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) is a set of tools and tests used to verify whether Jakarta EE technology implementations from vendors comply with the applicable specifications. The core purpose of TCK is to ensure compatibility, correctness, completeness, and consistency across different implementations. Each version of the Jakarta EE specification has a corresponding TCK test suite, and only by passing all TCK cases can one obtain the official Jakarta EE certification. This topic will discuss the setup and use of TCK, helping more enterprises join Jakarta EE.
    - name: Java Virtual Threads/Coroutines

        On January 1996, JDK 1.0 was released, and its green threads became the earliest coroutines in Java; in May 2000, JDK 1.3 was released, and green threads were removed, discarding the coroutine feature in Java; in September 2023, with the release of Java 21, Java gained coroutine support again through the virtual thread feature. The development course of Java coroutines not only reflects the trend of technological evolution but also embodies the exploration and innovation of countless Java developers. This topic will review this process, allowing us to better understand the value of coroutines in modern software development and provide ideas for application innovation, looking forward to everyone's participation.

        After the release of JMX 1.0 in September 2000, JVM and Java applications began to widely implement configuration and monitoring management through JMX. With the development of AOP, under the guidance of the Java APM concept, to solve the heterogeneity of language dependency on JVMTI, Java Instrumentation has pushed monitoring analysis based on bytecode technology to new heights, especially in the Java modules of today's cloud-native application architecture, where distributed tracing also widely uses bytecode enhancement technology. This topic will review and introduce Java monitoring and bytecode enhancement technology, analyzing how to build observable enterprise applications.

        JDK (Java Development Kit) is the software development kit for the Java language. It is the core of Java, containing the Java runtime environment (JVM), Java system libraries, and Java tools, providing full lifecycle support for the development, compilation, and execution of Java programs. OpenJDK is the open-source implementation of the Java SE (Java Platform, Standard Edition) specification. In 2006, Java was open-sourced and the Open JDK community was established, and in April 2009, it was officially released to the public under the GPL v2 + Classpath Exception agreement. After Oracle acquired Sun in 2009, the original Sun JDK also became Oracle JDK, which is the closed-source implementation of the Java SE specification, and OpenJDK has become an important open-source choice. This topic will introduce the origin of OpenJDK, the comparison between OpenJDK and Oracle JDK, and the mainstream OpenJDK distribution versions.

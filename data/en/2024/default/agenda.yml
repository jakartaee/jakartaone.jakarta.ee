        In the digital era, applications are becoming more varied than ever to
        address the diverse need of industries and users, ranging from small
        IoT deployments to hyperscale cloud environments. While considered by
        some an outdated application server solution, Jakarta EE can offer much
        more. Its APIs are uniquely positioned to meet these demands and
        support the applications of the future. In effect, Jakarta EE can be
        applied to support forward-looking, interoperable Platform Engineering
        practices that encompass edge devices all the way to complex,
        cloud-native microservices solutions. Even more, the latest new Jakarta
        EE Futures Interest Group will help keep the platform up-to-date to
        address future needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This session will explore why Jakarta EE is the optimal platform for
        future applications, particularly in supporting the scalability,
        flexibility and standardization required in modern digital ecosystems.
        Ultimately, by relying on Jakarta EE developers and users can benefit
        from long-term success.

        Langchain4J is the de-facto, popular AI framework for Java developers
        and they’ve introduced AI Services, which the idea is to hide the
        complexities of interacting with LLMs and other components behind a
        simple API. Thus allowing developers to focus on writing business
        logic. This is achieved by declaratively define an interface with the
        desired API, and LangChain4j provides an object (proxy) that implements
        this interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        This talk shows how to achieve the same goal, using Langchain4J and let
        CDI container manage the proxy and injection (the same way Spring does
        with Spring AI on Spring Boot, and recently on Quarkus). A code demo with
        examples will be shown.

        Do you want to understand how Java Virtual Threads really work and
        whether the myths you heard about are true or not? Join me to find out.
        In this session, we’ll delve into how Java Virtual Threads work,
        dispelling myths and offering practical guidance on leveraging them
        effectively. Drawing from my experience with GlassFish and Grizzly,
        we’ll discuss when and how to harness virtual threads to optimize
        performance and resource utilization in your applications. Along the
        way, we’ll highlight common pitfalls to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll debunk a few myths about virtual threads and explain why you
        shouldn’t be afraid to use them. Furthermore, we’ll tackle the question
        of whether virtual threads pose a competition to reactive programming
        in Java or whether they can fit well together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me as we unravel the mysteries of Java Virtual Threads and learn
        that you can start using virtual threads right now with peace in your
        mind.

        In this talk we’ll take a look at the Security specs of Jakarta EE 11.
        Security is an overarching aspect of an application, and Jakarta
        Security is fundamental for applications ranging from traditional MVC
        to Jakarta REST based microservices or serverless functions. In this
        session we will dive into what’s already there and everything that’s in
        the works for Jakarta EE Security, including new features like: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-cert and Digest Security</li>
        <li>Authentication mechanism per URL</li>
        <li>User choice of authentication mechanism (login with provider X or Y, etc)</li>
        <li>Multiple authentication mechanisms (try JWT, fallback to BASIC, ...)
        <li><code>@RolesAllowed</code> alternative</li>
        <li>Easily adding an interceptor to a built-in CDI bean</li>
        <li>Authorization modules</li>

        In the fast-evolving world of enterprise software, aligning your
        architecture with business goals is crucial. This presentation will
        show you how Jakarta Data can be the key to achieving a genuinely
        domain-centric design, fully embracing the principles of Domain-Driven
        Design (DDD) within your enterprise Java architecture. You will learn
        how Jakarta Data simplifies the integration of DDD by providing robust
        tools for modeling, managing, and accessing data in a way that closely
        aligns with your domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        This session will demonstrate, through practical examples and best
        practices, how Jakarta Data can be seamlessly integrated into your DDD
        strategy, leading to more maintainable, scalable, and agile enterprise
        applications. Whether you’re modernizing legacy systems or building new
        applications, this presentation will equip you with the knowledge and
        tools to elevate your enterprise architecture through the power of
        Jakarta Data and DDD.

        Since its introduction in 2018 as Jakarta EE, the platform has evolved
        from: Jakarta EE 8, an open-source version of Java EE 8; to Jakarta EE 9,
        the "big bang" release; to Jakarta EE 10 that introduced the Core
        Profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, Jakarta EE 11, focuses on productivity and innovation and
        delivers: updates to 16 specifications; introduces a new specification,
        Jakarta Data; and sets the baseline to Java 21, the latest LTS
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        This presentation will provide a brief history of Java EE/Jakarta EE,
        what's new in Jakarta EE 11, and a review of new and updated
        specifications with working example applications that are available on

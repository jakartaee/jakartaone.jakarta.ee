      presenter: Sebastian Daschner
      type: panel
      time: 10:00 - 11:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>This session shows how to implement cloud-native microservices using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile. We will develop a mesh of microservices, powered by Quarkus, and managed by Kubernetes and Istio. </p>
    - name: Kubernetes Native Java with MicroProfile and Quarkus

      type: panel
      time: 11:00 - 12:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>Java doesn’t work well in a container on Kubernetes right? Too big? Too slow to start? Not anymore with Quarkus! Quarkus significantly reduces the container resource requirements for memory and startup, while still supporting standard APIs like Eclipse MicroProfile.</p>
    - name: "Jakarta EE + MicroProfile + Kubernetes = The Productivity Dream #slideless"

      type: panel
      time: 12:00 - 13:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>Small deployable, fast deployments, clear cut between infrastructure and business logic, stable and rich Java environment, functionality on top of CNCF standards. In this session, Adam will explain productivity with plain code and from scratch. Multiple Kubernetes deployments included. A live coding session with ongoing Q&A.</p>
    - name: Building 12-factor Cloud Native Microservices
      vod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJHfMkogoj8&list=PLutlXcN4EAwDbPyz-X-ucOSUQgYgUkff7&index=5&t=0s
      presenter: Emily Jiang
      type: panel
      time: 13:00 - 14:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>Planning to build microservices? The b(EDT) practice of building a first-class Cloud Native Microservice is to follow12-Factor app. But how do you fulfil the 12-factor app rules, e.g. how do you externalize the configuration, fault tolerance, etc? Come to this session to build a 12-factor microservice using MicroProfile programming mode (microprofile.io) and Open Liberty (openliberty.io) with a live code demo!</p>
    - name: Fly Like a Rocket with Helidon 2.0

      type: panel
      time: 14:00 - 15:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>Come to our live-coding session to learn about new features added in Helidon 2.0 such as GraalVM native image support in Helidon MP, MicroProfile Reactive Streams and Reactive Stream Operators, Helidon DB Client and HTTP Client in Helidon SE. </p>
    - name: MicroProfile Reactive for Java Enterprise Developers
      vod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNdlb2Ehl9w&list=PLutlXcN4EAwDbPyz-X-ucOSUQgYgUkff7&index=3&t=0s
      presenter: Dr. Clement Escoffier
      type: panel
      time: 15:00 - 16:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>Reactive can be seen as a way to build better Cloud applications - more responsive, more elastic, more robust. In this talk, we explore the changes made in MicroProfile to bring reactive to enterprise development. Want to see how enterprise Java is morphing to become more reactive? How JAX-RS applications can stream data and embrace reactive programming? Then, don’t miss this talk!</p>
    - name: MicroProfile, your CloudNative companion for Enterprise Java
      vod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWg_h0XSDcc&list=PLutlXcN4EAwDbPyz-X-ucOSUQgYgUkff7&index=2&t=0s

      type: panel
      time: 16:00 - 17:00 (EDT)
      abstract: <p>When writing micro-services, you need a few goodies for the distributed environment you are running in. With Eclipse MicroProfile you can use etcd for Configuration, OpenTracing and Jaeger for Distributed Tracing and Prometheus for Metrics in combination with your Jakarta EE Application. This session show how you can achieve this with Payara Micro.</p>

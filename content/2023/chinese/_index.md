Dear Java and Cloud-native technology enthusiasts, the JakartaOne Livestream Chinese conference 2023 has been a great success!

JakartaOne Livestream is an online conference organized by the Jakarta EE working group for developers and technical leaders, focusing on enterprise-level Java applications and cloud native technologies, discussing the current status and future trends of Jakarta EE technology development.

This event explored in-depth the ideas, benefits, and development of cloud native application middleware, analyzed the strategies and paths for migrating enterprise Java EE applications to the Jakarta EE environment, studied innovative Java applications and optimization methods for Jakarta EE cloud native bootstrapping, and revealed the development process, core concepts, and distributed models of Java transaction processing.

In this conference, we also shared development practices for building cloud native applications based on MicroProfile, providing practical and feasible technical guidance for you.

In the JakartaOne Livestream conference, many developers and global top technology experts and developers discussed the development trends of the cloud native era and moved towards key milestones of the cloud native era together!

Both seasoned Java developers or emerging cloud native application developer have gained insights from this JakartaOne Livestream technology event. Looking forward to meeting again next year!

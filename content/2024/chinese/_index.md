JakartaOne Livestream is an online conference organized by the Jakarta EE
working group for developers and technical leaders, focusing on
enterprise-level Java applications and cloud native technologies, discussing
the current status and future trends of Jakarta EE technology development.

This event explored in-depth the ideas, benefits, and development of cloud
native application middleware, analyzed the strategies and paths for migrating
enterprise Java EE applications to the Jakarta EE environment, studied
innovative Java applications and optimization methods for Jakarta EE cloud
native bootstrapping, and revealed the development process, core concepts, and
distributed models of Java transaction processing.

In this conference, we also shared development practices for building cloud
native applications based on MicroProfile, providing practical and feasible
technical guidance for you.

In the JakartaOne Livestream conference, many developers and global top
technology experts and developers discussed the development trends of the cloud
native era and moved towards key milestones of the cloud native era together!

Both seasoned Java developers or emerging cloud native application developer
have gained insights from this JakartaOne Livestream technology event. Looking

Dear Java and Cloud-native technology enthusiasts,

We are pleased to share with you a summary of the recently concluded JakartaOne Livestream Chinese conference 2024, an online gathering that brought together a vibrant community of developers and technical leaders.

The JakartaOne Livestream, organized by the Jakarta EE working group, was a resounding success, focusing on enterprise-level Java applications and cloud native technologies. It was a platform where the current status and future trends of Jakarta EE technology development were thoroughly discussed and dissected.

During this event, we had the opportunity to explore the latest developments in the Jakarta EE specification, delving into the intricacies of how to participate in and conduct TCK testing. We gained an in-depth understanding of the history of JDK, the evolution of Java threads and coroutines, and how to build application observability using JVM bytecode enhancement techniques. Additionally, we discussed the latest development practices of Java in the AI era, which was a highlight for many.

The conference was a melting pot of ideas, with many developers and global top technology experts coming together to discuss the development trends of the cloud native era. Together, we moved towards key milestones of the cloud native era, sharing insights and charting a course for future advancements.

Both seasoned Java developers and emerging cloud native application developers found the JakartaOne Livestream to be an insightful and enriching experience. The event has successfully concluded, leaving a lasting impact on all who participated, and we look forward to building on the knowledge and connections made during this conference.

Thank you for your participation, and we hope to see you at the next JakartaOne Livestream event.
